The goal of newpractice is to practice linking GitHub and RStudio to
track my research workflow, ensure reproducibility, and collaborate
effectively.

By integrating these tools, researchers can efficiently track code
changes, collaborate seamlessly, and document their entire process from
data analysis to manuscript development. GitHub allows for version
control, meaning every step in the research process is logged and
reversible, ensuring that all modifications can be traced back.
