The goal of newpractice is to practice linking GitHub and RStudio to track my research workflow, ensure reproducibility, and collaborate effectively. 

By integrating these tools, researchers can efficiently track code changes, collaborate seamlessly, and document their entire process from data analysis to manuscript development. GitHub allows for version control, meaning every step in the research process is logged and reversible, ensuring that all modifications can be traced back.
